# TOP
Project for OS course. We've implemented the "top" shell command in pure 'C'.

# Instructions
To run the code, just build the project using the makefile. Once in the directory of the project, just type the following:
```bash
make
```
To run the "top" command, just type:
```bash
./main
```
Once you run the code, by pressing "Ctrl+\\" it's possible to enter the pid of a process and choose either to terminate, kill, suspend or resume the process.
